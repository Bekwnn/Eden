imgui's example implementations for opengl3 and SDL need to have their headers modified to work with zig
here are the two modified versions which need to be copied/overwrite the corresponding files in cimgui/imgui/examples
they should have the original file names without the '-MODIFIED' at the end
Original ImGui license included here
